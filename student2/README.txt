This is the README doc for this project
Well explained and cool instructions on how project was set up and run

What I learnt about Version Control:
Version control is surpringly easy to implement and provides many advantages including:
-Access to old versions of documents
-Shared access repositories storage options
-Good collaboration options 
-Simplified management and development streamline

Even just performing this demonstration I can see how useful version control might be for a company.
Also, I forgot how useful GitHub was, it was nice relearning how to use that site again.

As for issue tracking:
-The process can be streamlined through repository services such as Github.
-Organization is made easy with branches and cloud/local updates
-Issues can be logically organized and sorted 
-Issue tracking is important to ensure everything is working properly 
-Vulnerabilties may be found if issue tracking not used 

Overall, this was a fun project and enjoyed learning how to use git with linux and relearning how Github functions.
I always forget linux commands so this was a nice refresher and a breath of fresh air from the writing in the previous two assignments.
