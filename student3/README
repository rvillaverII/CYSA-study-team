This is the README I completely messed up.
I deleted it because I didn't know better. There is practically no history.
I don't even know how this happened, because I thought the original README was in the student3 folder, but apparently not.

I have learned a lot regarding Git, mostly due to my many, many mistakes today.
I think my main source of confusion was with the idea of "merging", because it seems like that would mean the original and destination branches would actually merge, and become identical.
I definitely understand it much better now.
Hopefully, next time I have to use Git, I will be much better at it and make much fewer mistakes.
