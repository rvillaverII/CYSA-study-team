This project tests students' ability to implement version control.

During this assignement, I learned how to use version control to support cybersecurity. In cybersecurity, it's important that staff are able to collaborate effectively. Version control supports that by allowing employees to edit documents and push them to a centralized server. This allows other employees to pull the changed documents and edit them as needed. Additionallly, version control helps prevent data loss by creating logs, and backups of documents. When a document is changed, an employee will commit and merge it to other branches. These actions create logs that allow employees to track the versions of a document, which helps with recovering backups if needed. Version control also improves security. Logs provide detailed insight into changes. This includes who made the change, when they made the change, and why they made the change (if added). Using these logs, suspicious activity can be identified and dealt with. Using version control, organizations can improve their cybersecurity posture.
