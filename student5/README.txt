From this assignment I learned how to use github for version control. Version control is important in a cybersecurity context because you can see the history of what changes
are made. You can also easily revert chanages in case of any errors that may occur. 
I found it most challenging learning how to use git to pull from remote repositories.
It was also challenging getting to know all the git commands and learning how to use them.
